**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Sundroid - An open source project for the Android platform. Project is designed to search for tourist locations with the best weather conditions using Google APIs.

Users can enter a location and radius to search. The app uses Google Places API to fetch all points of interest around the entered location and Google weather API to get weather conditions of those places. The requests for these APIs return xml files and we have written appropriate XML parsers to fetch required values. The places are sorted based on weather conditions into "Sunny", "Clear", "cloudy" ,"rainy" and certain other categories. The app finally suggests top 5 locations to visit on that particular day in the order. When none of the locations are sunny or clear the app suggests movies or restaurants.

-Application is written in Java
-Application uses Google Places API and Google Weather API Powered by GOOGLE

**FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

Currently the application has two input boxes: one for the zip code/name of place and the second input box for entering the miles to search for. 
In future, we plan to have a third input box so that the user can enter his/her choice of places to search for. 
For instance national/state parks, events, hikes, historical landmarks, shopping locations, restaurants, museums etc. The application will then search for the places of interest with a pleasant weather in miles of the zip code entered. 
Also, on clicking the suggestion, the application will return the address and distance of the place from the place entered. This can also give us the best routes which might be fetched from Directions API. We are yet to research more on that.

Choosing boundaries and locations from map is another feature we want to implement in future. 
Choosing some location on the map should fetch the co-ordinates and help us find nearby locations using google api.

We also plan to make the search more effective by considering the best season/months to visit the place 
by considering many other factors apart from just weather conditions.
