Following are the instructions to build the application:

1. Confirm that your development computer has the following system requirements:
   JDK 5 or JDK 6 (JRE alone is not sufficient) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
   Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) or greater (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
   ADT plugin for eclipse

2. Install SDK platform: Select Windows > Android SDK and AVD Manager, choose Available Packages in the left panel. Click the repository site checkbox to display the components available for installation. Select SDK Platform Android 2.2, API 8, revision 2 and click Install Selected. 

3. Create an Android virtual device which is an Android emulator: In Eclipse, choose Window > Android SDK and AVD Manager. Select Virtual Devices in the left panel. Click New. The Create New AVD dialog appears. Type the name of the AVD, such as "my_avd". Choose target as SDK 2.2 and click Create AVD.

4. Pull or clone the repository on Github in a folder into your local computer using the following commands:
   cd <path of the local folder>
   git remote add origin git@github.com/elakkiya:NewSundroid

   A folder called sundroid will be created in your local folder.

5. Open eclipse and make the folder your current workspace.
